# Analysis_of _40_Years_of_Evolution_data
"Many of the important observations that led Charles Darwin to develop the theory of evolution were made in the Galápagos archipelago. Particularly in the study of the small birds, called finches, that inhabit them.

Every year since 1973, Peter and Rosemary Grant of Princeton University have been spending several months of the year on the tiny volcanic cinder cone island of Daphne Major in the Galápagos.

This island has two dominant ground finch species, Geospiza fortis and Geospiza scandens. The Grants have monitored them every year, tagging them, making physiological measurements, taking samples for genetic sequencing, and more.

In 2014, they published a book entitled "40 Years of Evolution: Darwin's Finches on Daphne Major Island". They generously placed all of their data on the Dryad data repository making it free for anyone to use." Justin Bois-Lecturer at the California Institute of Technology

## This project presents an analysis of their data carried out as part of datacamp course: Statistical Thinking in Python
This analysis explores the dataset, describes it, and draws conclutions using inferential statitics techniques like parameter estimation, hypothesis test, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.
