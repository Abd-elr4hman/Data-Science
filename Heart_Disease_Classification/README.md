# Heart_Disease_DecisionTree_classifier
This project Uses Decision Trees to classify the Heat disease dataset from UCI machine learning repository.
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease.

This project presents:
- Preprocessing and prepairing the dataset.
- Building a preliminary decision tree classifier.
- Improving model performance with Grid cross validation.
- Using various ensemble methods like bagging and AdaBoosting to build even better classifiers 

Dependancies:
- python 3.7
- scikit learn 1.0.0
- numpy 1.21
- pandas 1.3.4
- matplotlib  3.4.3
