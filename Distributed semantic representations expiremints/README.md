# Distributed semantic representations expiremints
In this project I expirement with distributed semantic representations.

- Dense distributed representations represent words as embeddings in a continuous vector space where semantically similar words are mapped to nearby points.
- in this notebook i test word2vec, Glove50d and Glive100d embeddings on 4 different analogy tests to measure to what extent are embedding models able to capture semantic relationships(and surplrisingly more!) between words.
- The goal of the analogy tests is to predict the 4th entry in a row given the analogy expressed by the first 3 words.

Dependancies:
- python 3.7
- gensim 
- re 
- tqdm
